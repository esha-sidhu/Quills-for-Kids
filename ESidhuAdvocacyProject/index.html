      <h2> About Quills for Kids </h2>
      <p> Quills for Kids is a movement by Calligraphy By Esha that aims 
        to spread joy to hospital patients by gifting them cards of 
        support and encouragement.
      </p>
      <p> For every card that is bought through the Calligraphy By Esha 
        shop, one card is sent to hospital patients in the community. If 
        you would rather donate without purchasing from the shop, there 
        is an option to donate directly to our cause, and the money will 
        be used to purchase supplies for the cards, without first needing 
        to purchase a card from the shop.
      </p>
      <p> This movement is aimed to spread joy to what can otherwise be a 
        scary, nerve-wracking, and/or painful experience. The core value 
        of Calligraphy By Esha is to spread joy to the community, so this 
        movement is a natural next step.

          <p> Sign this petition to increase funds for hospitals to increase funding for activities to engage the kids during their stay. There are some grants dedicated to this, and some non-profit organizations who also are trying to collect funds to donate and create grants to fund activities for kids while staying in the hospital.</p>
          <p>This is a topic important to Quills for Kids, so we decided to start a petition to get more funding towards fun and stress-relieving activities for kids during their hospital stay, since many activities are not engaging to kids, and the ones that are come from volunteers. </p>
